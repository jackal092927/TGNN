"""
The Exact Node Identity Issue in GNNs for Triadic Closure

USER'S BRILLIANT INSIGHT:
"When we compute node embedding for pair (u,v), if we want to check node w,
if w is common neighbor of u and v, we need node id so both u and v know
the message is from the SAME node w during message passing"

Let's break this down step by step with concrete examples.
